Title: A Phase III Clinical Trial of Drug X for Hypertension
Abstract:
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety and efficacy of Drug X in treating patients with Stage 2 hypertension. A total of 1,200 adult patients aged 40–70 years were enrolled across 20 centers in the US. Patients received either Drug X (100 mg daily) or a placebo for 12 weeks.
The primary outcome was a reduction in systolic blood pressure. Secondary outcomes included evaluation of side effects, drug tolerability, and any interactions with commonly used antihypertensives.
Results:
Drug X significantly reduced systolic blood pressure by an average of 18 mmHg compared to 6 mmHg in the placebo group (p < 0.01).
Common side effects included headache (12%), dizziness (9%), nausea (6%), and fatigue (4%). One serious adverse event was reported (liver enzyme elevation), leading to discontinuation in a single patient.
Interaction studies showed increased plasma concentration of atenolol when co-administered with Drug X, requiring dosage adjustments.
Conclusion:
Drug X demonstrated efficacy in lowering blood pressure and had a manageable side effect profile. Monitoring is advised when used with beta blockers due to pharmacokinetic interactions.
